**Tools Used**: Microsoft Excel 2021  

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical data on US public debt to identify trends, provide insights, and offer recommendations for debt management. Through data analysis and visualizations, this project showcases the impacts of economic events like the COVID-19 pandemic and seasonal debt trends.

### Objective
To uncover insights from US debt data that can inform policy decisions and management strategies.

### Key Questions
1. What was the yearly debt increase percentage?
2. Which months show the highest and lowest debt increases?
3. What is the projected debt growth over the next few years?

## Data Summary
- **Source**: Public Dataset  
- **Structure**: Time-series data with some missing values and gaps, reshaped for analysis.
- **Cleaning**: Converted debt values from scientific notation, managed nulls, and standardized formats.

## Analysis & Findings
- **Debt Spike in 2020**: Increased by 19.6%, influenced by the US-China trade war and COVID-19 recession.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Debt rises from November to February due to fiscal cycles; stabilizes from April to July.
- **Long-term Growth**: Debt grew from $5T (1993) to $17T (2019), projected to reach $33T by 2027.

## Impact on Citizens
- **Higher Taxes and Costs**: Debt could lead to increased taxes, inflation, and higher borrowing costs.
  
## Recommendations
1. Reallocate spending to essential sectors.
2. Increase fiscal oversight to reduce waste.
3. Manage debt through efficient policies.
4. Improve transparency in fiscal decisions.

## Challenges
- Inconsistent data from 1993-2004 limits historical analysis.
- Missing records on certain days impact monthly trends.
- External events, like COVID-19, influence long-term debt trends unpredictably.
